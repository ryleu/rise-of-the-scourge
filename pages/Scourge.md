- The [[Scourge]] is an extension of the elder god [[Raznesh]]. It can infect anything left near it for long enough, regardless of whether the target is living or dead. If the victim is sentient, [[Raznesh]] speaks into the minds of the victim, probing at it until it finally caves to his will. Strong-willed individuals can resist for an extended period of time, but not forever. Those who are overcome by the [[Scourge]] are [Scourge Thralls]([[Scourge Thrall]]), and should not be considered as they once were. There is no known cure.
