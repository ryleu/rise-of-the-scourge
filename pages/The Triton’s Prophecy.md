- > The day will come when the Eel, full of hate, eats her father and seeks for another. In a visit to that place beyond sleep, the Eel finds her new father, and embraces her place as [the Scourge Daughter]([[Remiri Zahra]]). Out of spite, She will take what is due the Koi, courageous and strong as they may be, and with her poison, the Eel defeats even the proud Shark, leaving him and his to be feasted on. Her creations will rise from the Deep Black to bring us victory over the above. And when the night is long, the Pillars of the Mother will rise to stop the Eel, then the Father will reign, and the conquest will be won.
