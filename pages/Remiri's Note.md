- [[Remiri Zahra]] gave the party this note as a trade for the fake scroll:
  > To find [Leoben]([[King Leoben]]), find a grungy tattoo parlor near the port called [Inks and Drinks]([[Inks, Drinks, and Kinks]]) . The lady who runs the place, [[Rafia]] , can show you where he is. You may not believe me, but I and the [order](the [[Order of Silence]]) aren’t on the same team. We're more like business partners that occasionally help each other, but our end-games are far from the same. [The Order](the [[Order of Silence]]) doesn’t work for the [[Scourge]], they’re actually trying to control it. They want to upturn the world order and put themselves on top. I'm not sure how they plan on doing this, but their leader, the [[Survivor of Viril]], has hinted to me that he has a way of controlling the [[Vilebeasts]]. I was offered an invitation, but declined, which seemed to upset them.
