- > [[Lady Norwick]]. I don’t think you understand your position in this matter. You were never meant to take the throne. It was always our plan that we destroy the palace and the city with it. The information [[King Leoben]] stored in that room of his is too important to let out. These are the measures that must be taken to insure that doesn’t happen. You will continue the summoning. [[The Colossus]] will destroy the city. And if you do everything as I tell you to, you will be rewarded in the [[New World]] I am creating, a world without those [Golden Hearth]([[The Golden Hearth]]) hypocrites. And watch your tongue. I don’t like back talk.
