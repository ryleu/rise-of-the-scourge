- [Ravenswon]([[Alderman Ravenswon]]), you have failed. You’ve let [Melia]([[Princess Melia]])’s champions slip through your fingers and acquire one of the [Relics](the [[Relics of Light]]) . Months ago, [[Lady Norwick]] was slain because of the same negligence. Every [Onlooker]([[Onlookers]]) I’ve spoken with has said the same thing regarding your future: you will die, and the [[Lurker]] will be lost to us. I’m cutting ties, [Ravenswon]([[Alderman Ravenswon]]). My only regret is that the [[New Devout]] will give you a death without suffering. 
  You will receive no further assistance from the [[Spire of Viril]] , and your [[Mirror Portal]] has been deactivated. Prove the [[Onlookers]] wrong, prove FATE wrong, and I might be persuaded to grant you access once again.
  \- the [[Survivor of Viril]] .
