- [[Aleon]] performed experiments on [[The Scourge]]. These are his notes.
- ## Entry 1
  > [Scourge]([[The Scourge]]) samples, as expected, react violently with raw elements, quickly integrating them into their biomass. Generally, metals are integrated more quickly than other elements. I suspect that this property was originally an adaptation made by [[The Scourge]] to combat the metal armor worn by our people in its 2nd coming.
- ## Entry 2
  > If heated before and during their suspension in [[The Scourge]]'s biomass, most salts are able to maintain their shape and form for multiple hours. I wonder if this speaks to a hidden holy nature they have. That would explain why they are used in many of our traditions and rituals.
- ## Entry 3
  > [Scourge]([[The Scourge]]) samples are becoming increasingly violent. It may be time for me to put these experiments to rest and focus more keenly on saving this country.
