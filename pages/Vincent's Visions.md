- After talking to—and subsequently killing—Vincent, the party entered his cell and found visions carved into the walls.
-
- > [[Vivre Rahon]] will be infected with [[Scourge Kiss]] and turn into [[The Stalker]].
- This vision has already come true. The party slew [[The Stalker]].
-
- > [[The Golden Threads]] ? We won’t get them.
- This may be in reference to the fact that the party found [[The Golden Threads]] before [[The Order of Silence]] did.
-
- > [[Austasia]] doesn’t belong to us yet! But maybe soon?
- It seems that the party thwarted this for now by destroying [[The Stalker]].
-
- > The Mythling father will die at our hands hahahahahahahahaha.
- Poor [[Glubathan Nordicus Phimata V]].
-
- > Red red, old target…Pink Pink, New Target!
- Unsure if this has come true. Who or what is pink? Perhaps [[Rosemary Holloway]]?
-
- > Yellow Sword? Is it ours? Can’t see yet.
- Unknown what this references. Perhaps one of [[The Relics of Light]]?
-
- > Storm… Soon… soon indeed.
- Could be in reference to [[The Storm]]?
