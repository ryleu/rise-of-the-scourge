- [[Ammit Zahra]] carried this scroll wherever he went. It is his birthright, a way to lead him to [[Scourge Bane]]. Now that he is dead, this right falls to [[Remiri Zahra]].
- > Child of Power, the time has come. My name is [[Kahl the Mountain]], Zahra, one of the [[Five Devout]] of the [[Golden Hearth]]. I am your ancestor. We have just defeated the [[Scourge]], but Mother [[Evalla]] tells us that it will return one day far in the future and try to take the world from us again. You, as my kin, have claim to my [Relic of Light](the [[Relics of Light]]), the weapon I used in the war against the [[Scourge]]. When it returns, [the Relics](the [[Relics of Light]]) must be reassembled to resist the rot of the [[Scourge]]. This Scroll is both the compass and key to my Relic, [[Scourge Bane]]. Claim it as your own. Defeat the [[Scourge]] for our Mother [[Evalla]].
