## Entry 1
> They didn’t believe that she would come. They doubted the [prophecy]([[Triton’s Prophecy]]). They slandered it as just “Old superstition”. But at last, she’s come to liberate us. The one who can command [[The Scourge]]. The one who can harness its power and strengthen us. [The Scourge Daughter]([[Remiri Zahra]]). I can hardly contain my excitement. I’ll have Zenth’s head if he’s wrong about this. I have to tell the others that our time has come to overthrow this new regime and return to our roots. [Scourge Daughter]([[Remiri Zahra]]), I know you can’t read this, but I pledge my life to you.

  > [The Scourge Daughter]([[Remiri Zahra]]), she says that she can use [[The Scourge]] to strengthen us without taking away our consciousness, just as the [prophecy]([[Triton’s Prophecy]]) said she could do. Testing begins sometime next Tide Cycle. Hopefully I'll be selected.
